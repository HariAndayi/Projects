Project 1: Login Application with Validation

Developed a login application that validates input fields. Ensured the fields are not empty on submission, the username is a valid email address, and the password is more than 8 characters. Validation employs three alternatives: Functional, OOP, and Procedural programming.


Project 2: Grading System Program

Developed a program that takes marks as input and awards the appropriate grade based on USIU's grading system. The program continues taking marks input from the user and displays the appropriate grades, terminating only upon the user's command using loops.
